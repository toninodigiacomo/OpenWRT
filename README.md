# OpenWrt Project
The OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. This frees us from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows us to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.
